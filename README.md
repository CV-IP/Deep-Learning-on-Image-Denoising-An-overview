## Absract
#### Deep learning techniques have obtained much attention in image denoising. However, deep learning methods of different types deal with the noise have enormous differences. Specifically, discriminative learning based on deep learning can well address the Gaussian noise. Optimization model methods based on deep learning have good effect on estimating of the real noise. So far, there are little related researches to summarize different deep learning techniques for image denoising. In this paper, we make such a comparative study of different deep techniques in image denoising. We first classify the (1) deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for additive white noisy images, (2) deep CNNs for real noisy images, (3) deep CNNs for blind denoising and (4) deep CNNs for hybrid noisy images, which is the combination of noisy, blurred and low-resolution images. Then, we analyze the motivations and principles of deep learning methods of different types. Next, we compare and verify the state-of-the-art methods on public denoising datasets in terms of quantitative and qualitative analysis. Finally, we point out some potential challenges and directions of future research.
